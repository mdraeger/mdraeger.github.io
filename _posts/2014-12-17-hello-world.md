### Here we are ...
Welcome to my blog, that I shall use to share ideas and insights which I had during my 
small steps in the world of programming.

Actually, I already have a project in mind, that I would like to pursue a little bit:

[Leif Grele](https://hrothen.github.io) started an interesting blog about building a 
toy browser engine in Haskell. He himself is implementing the original (written in Rust)
by [Matt Brubeck](http://limpet.net/mbrubeck).

So I thought, a version in Scala wouldn't hurt too much. We will see, how this idea 
plays out in the end.
